# Process Plan Document â€“ Team 25

## 1 Introduction
The software is a simple tool, usable by students, to perform a simple check on of the average word count per sentence in an text document.

The project sponsor has asked to have an application created to allow student essays to be analyzed to determine the average sentence length within the essay.   The average sentence length will be calculated using the number of words in each sentence.  The sponsor would like to be able to configure a minimum word length, as well as what punctuation should be used to determine the end of a sentence.  This project will produce a single, stand-alone application that can be run from a computer command line.
