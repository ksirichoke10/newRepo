# Process Plan Document – Team 25

## **1 Introduction**

The project sponsor has asked for the creation of an application that will analyze a student's essay and determine its average sentence length. The name of this software product will be the Average Sentence Length Application (ASLA). ASLA will be a single, stand-alone application that the user can run from a command line in a terminal window. The user will be able to specify the preferred delimiters as well as a word length limit. In order to analyze an essay, the user must use the command line to specify a file path to the essay. ASLA will scan the essay and output the average sentence length onto the user’s computer screen. If the application is run with no arguments, help information will be displayed on the screen. This application does not fix the spelling or grammatical errors of the essay, and it does not provide an overall word count.     

### 1.1 Definitions and Acronyms

The following is a list of definitions and acronyms that will be used for this project:

- **ASLA** - Average Sentence Length Application

- **LM** - Lifecycle Model

- **SPM** - Software Process Model

- **Waterfall** - A Lifecycle or Software Process Model that follows a sequential order of process steps or phases.  

- **Word** – a single distinct meaningful element of speech or writing, used with others (or sometimes alone) to form a sentence and typically shown with a space on either side when written or printed.

- **Sentence separator** – Punctuation that separates the start of a new sentence.  

- **Command line argument** - Parameters that can be added to the command instructions to cause different program behavior.  
- **JAVA**- An object oriented programming language used to deliver software programs on multiple operating systems.

- **Terminal** – A program, or emulator, which provides a text-based interface for typing commands.

- **UML** - Unified Modeling Language.  Modeling process used to document software design elements.


## **2 Process Description**

### 2.1 Project Lifecycle

A Waterfall Lifecycle Model (LM) will be used to manage the ASLA project.  Due to the scope of this project, the Architectural Design and the Detailed Design will be combined into a single phase. 

The ASLA project will progress through the following phases:

*Software Concept -> Requirements Analysis ->Architectural and Detailed Design -> Coding and Debugging -> System Testing*

Between each phase there will be a review to determine if the project can advance to the next phase. This will allow the team to find errors earlier in the lifecycle.  Between each phase there is a set of criteria that will be established to allow the advancement to the next phase.

For this project, the following will be accomplished during each phase:

- **Software Concept** – During this phase the initial software concept will be discussed and requirements will be gathered.
 - Criteria for Advancement-  Process document completed
- **Requirements Analysis** - During this phase the customer requirements will be gathered.  In our case, we will review the video and extract requirements from P1L5: Project Description.
    - Criteria for Advancement-  Requirements document completed
- **Architectural and  Detailed Design**- Design of the application which includes the user interface and JAVA class structure.
    - Criteria for Advancement-  Design document completed.
- **Coding and Debugging**- Coding the application and debugging code by the developer.
    - Criteria for Advancement- Application development, unit testing, and test plan document completed.
- **System Testing** – Testing performed against test cases defined by a tester based on application requirements and detailed design
    - Criteria for Advancement- Test plan activities completed.
